# This has been patched, use at your own risk
1. Exploitative methods of XP farming will be treated seriously by as RIOT "won't show mercy next time". They have mentioned that one punishment will be "Permanent Suspension" which is essentially a permanent account ban and a 3 month HWID ban.

2. Future XP farming scripts/bots will now be treated as a third-party tool and on the same level as cheating. You will be perma-banned if found botting, alongside being HWID banned. The only way to circumvent a HWID ban is to buy a new PC or wait 90 days to get unbanned. 
If anyone ever does think of possibly using a spoofer, you're out of luck. All previous methods are now patched (there were only like 2 methods in the entire existence of the game lol), and Vanguard boots up when you see the BIOS screen, so it just isn't going to happen.
